🔐 Password Strength Checker

This is a simple Python script that checks how strong a user's password is based on five common criteria:

1. ✅ Minimum length (8 characters)
2. 🔠 Contains uppercase letters
3. 🔡 Contains lowercase letters
4. 🔢 Contains numbers
5. 🔣 Contains special characters (e.g. !@#$%)

The script returns:
- A score out of 5
- A qualitative strength level (e.g., Very Weak, Medium, Very Strong)
- Helpful feedback on how to improve the password
- Suggestions to make the password more secure

💡 Ideal for:
- Beginners learning Python
- Anyone wanting a lightweight tool to evaluate password strength
- Educational or demonstration purposes

Run the script in a terminal or command line, enter a password, and receive instant feedback.
